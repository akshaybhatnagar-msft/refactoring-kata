# ML Inference Service Refactoring Challenge

## Overview

The `ml_inference_service.py` file contains a working but poorly structured ML inference service. Your task is to refactor this code to improve maintainability, testability, and production readiness.

## Your task
- Find and fix any bug you see in this code
- Fix design issues you see in the code
- Anything else you would like to cover

## Requirements

Refactor while preserving all functionality:
Bonus points for thinking about scalability (how to support other models), latency and monitoring

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Review `ml_inference_service.py`
3. Identify architectural problems
4. Refactor into well-structured components
5. Document your design decisions

## Deliverables
Please create a PR and I will review it for you. Minimum requirements -

- Refactored code with proper separation of concerns
- Brief explanation of your architectural choices
- Configuration management approach

** If you use any AI help, please be honest and tell me where and how. I am okay with you using some AI tooling for writing code but the ideas have to be yours. For example -
- It's oaky to ask AI - can you show me a small sample snippet for how to read/write files from a network
- It's not okay to ask AI - review this code and clean it up as per my interviewer
